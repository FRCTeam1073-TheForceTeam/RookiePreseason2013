#Getting Started

Make an account on Github (this website), and send an email to <a href="mailto://evinoog96@gmail.com>Evin</a> with your GitHub account name. You'll be added to the team repository and will then be able to work with our code when and whereever you want.

##When we meet
We meet every Wednesday at 6:30 in the tech lab!

##Questions, Ideas, Suggestions
Software on Team 1073 is all about growing as a programmer and an indiviudal. A crucial element in this is asking questions - we love it when questions are asked! If there is anything that you're curious about, please do not hesitate to email or ask any of us in person what's on your mind. We welcome all ideas and questions.

##Stuff to download

* A git client - this will allow you to modify and submit code for everyone else on the team to work with. Even this file itself is hosted in a _git repository_! We will be using and teaching Git throughout the coming weeks, a good client to download (and one that most of use here) is the <a href="https://windows.github.com">Windows Client by GitHub</a>. If you're familiar with Git and you have another client of choice, feel free to use it :)
* A Text Editor, you can edit any bit of code that we do here in Notepad, however we encourage you to work with an editor that has special features that make it easier to read and write code. A good program for this is <a href="https://SublimeText.com">Sublime Text</a> although **many** others do exist out there, and we encourage you to use whatever you'd prefer!

##Where to go from here
Every meeting will have a folder in this repository that contains any code we've worked on that night, and two text files `MeetingSummary.txt` and `MoreFun.txt`.
* `MeetingSummary.txt` will contain a summary of the meeting - stuff that we covered, code that we've worked on, any important announcements and any other relavent info.
* `MoreFun.txt`	 will contain some supplementary material that builds on the stuff we worked with during our last meeting. Expect other online resources, programming problems, projects, and more. Naturally, this is optional, but you'll get a lot out more  of your preseason by opening up these files every now and then!
