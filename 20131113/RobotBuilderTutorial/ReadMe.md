Robot Builder is an application that we use to outline and then auto-generate robot code. 
Subsytems and commands work together to make a functioning system called WPILib's Command-Based-Robot.

### Subsytems

A robot has Subsystems, that model physical parts of the robot ex. DriveTrain, Grabber...

### Commands 
 
Robots also have commands, or actions that can either be looping or executed once, commands are like verbs ex. Shoot (One Time Only), DriveWithJoysticks (Looping until overriden)
