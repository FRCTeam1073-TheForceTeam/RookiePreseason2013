###Starting tonight we will branch off and try a few different projects!

##Program a basic robot

Using the Robot Builder configuration in this repository we will write C++ code that make a robot drive and shoot. This project will also introduce RobotBuilder and the WindRiver IDE.

##Work with Willie on Diagnostics Software
Begin work and exposure to special software and hardware that is constructed to test robots for flaws during build season.

##Review Object Oriented LED work with Arduinos
Let's make sure everyone has finished their LED code on the Arduino. 

##More OO Work on the Arduino 
Write a class similar to the `LED` class called `LEDNetwork` that manages several LEDs. the `LED`s in an `LEDNetwork` should be easy to turn on and off. An `LEDNetwork` will store an array of `LED` objects. Write methods in the `LEDNetwork` class called `allOn()` and `allOff()` that turn on every `LED` it stores on and off respectively. Once you're finished, write some other methods of your own and show them to your Software mentors and teammates!
