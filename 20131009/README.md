# Exercises
Goal: to use what you have learned about functions, if/then/else, for loops and Arduino to do some more complex things.
## Exercise 1: Get user input and blink
Project: request a number from the user and control the blink rate of an LED connected to pin 3 of the Arduino through a 1k Ohm resistor.

Fill in the missing parts denoted by a ??? to get it to work. ??? may represent more than one line of missing code.
## Exercise 2: Use an if statement
Extend so that if user inputs "0 [1 or 2]", the code uses the second number to decide which LED to blink (1 for onboard, 2 for external). If anything else, it writes an error message to the console telling them what to enter.
## Exercise 3: Use a for loop
Extend the code to use a 200 ms delay between blinks and use a for loop to blink from 1 to the number the user enters (Default 5), then wait 1 second
## Exercise 4: Get clever

* do more complex things with the LED arduino
* build a circuit with a speaker and generate notes
* build a circuit with other hardware and control it
