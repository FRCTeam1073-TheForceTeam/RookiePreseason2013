Hi Software,

We hope you had a great first meeting tonight! Here are some things to get going on!

#Stuff to see and do

* <strong><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">CodeCademy JavaScript courses</a></strong> - The JavaScript courses on this website are a great intro to programming. At your own speed, you can learn the basic mechanics what it is to program! We don't do very much in JavaScript as a team, however it's a good language to familiarize yourself with code and key elements in them like `if statements`, `loops` and more. The goal is for you to bring your knowledge from CodeCademy to our meetings!
* <strong><a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1"> Learn Git in 15 Minutes</a></strong> - We use Git to manage all of our code and files as a subgroup. This website will teach you the basics of git. Learning git is a must for being a contributing member of this subgroup... In addition to this video, we will be showing you how to use the tool throughout the year, and you'll be working with it as you develop code in the coming weeks.
* <a href="https://github.com/FRCTeam1073-TheForceTeam/">Our old code...</a> - If you're feeling gung-ho about Software on FIRST Team 1073, please can check out some of the stuff we've done in past years! We have all of our recent repositories hosted on this website (including this very document)


Thanks so much for coming, and remember that we're all about working and growing together. Email or talk to us irl if you have any questions.
